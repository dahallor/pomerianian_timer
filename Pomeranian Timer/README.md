# Description

This is a type of productivity timer called a Pomodoro Timer. It's a type of productivity method used to work for extended hours without losing steam. The normal icon of this type of timer is a tomato, but instead I thought it would be more fun if it was pictures of pomeranians instead.

This is still WIP because I am busy with classes. I plan on fine tuning it soon but you can look through this personal project
